## ‚ú® Features

* **Dashboard View:** A centralized dashboard showing key metrics.
* **Data Table:** View and filter the raw climate data (`climate.csv`).
* **Specific Metrics:** Dedicated pages for detailed analysis of:
    * **Temperature**
    * **Rainfall**
    * **Humidity**
    * **Sea Level** (sea\_lavel.py)
    * **Wind**
* **Projections:** Future climate projections modeling.
* **Seasonal Analysis:** Breakdown of data by seasons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    cd CLIMATE-DATA-VISUALIZER
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # (Note: Assuming you have a requirements.txt file. If not, you will need to create one using 'pip freeze > requirements.txt')
    ```

4.  **Fetch Data:**
    *(If the `data/climate.csv` file needs to be generated or updated, run the fetch script):*
    ```bash
    python data/fetch_data.py
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    # (Note: Replace 'app.py' with your main application file, e.g., 'dashboard.py' if that's the entry point)
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (or similar port).

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is logically organized into distinct folders for easy maintenance:

* `assets/`: Static assets like images or custom fonts.
* `data/`: Data files (`climate.csv`) and data fetching scripts (`fetch_data.py`).
* `pages/`: All the Python files that define the individual pages/views of the application (e.g., `temperature.py`, `rainfall.py`).
* `static/`: Contains static web files like CSS (`privacy.css`).
* `templates/`: HTML templates (`privacy_policy.html`).
* `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
